# VT Code Project Analysis

## Executive Summary

-   **Architecture**: Binary entry point in `src/` orchestrates commands and delegates to reusable logic in `vtcode-core`, which houses configuration, LLM provider abstractions, tooling, and TUI rendering. F:src/main.rs†L5-L145F:vtcode-core/src/llm/providers/openrouter.rs†L1-L41F:vtcode-core/src/config/models.rs†L1-L119
-   **Strengths**: Clear separation between CLI and core library, comprehensive provider support, and centralized configuration constants promote consistency. F:Cargo.toml†L1-L103F:vtcode-core/src/config/models.rs†L1-L207
-   **Risks**: Several monolithic modules exceed 1.5k lines, increasing cognitive load and slowing iteration (e.g., TUI session management, unified turn loop, ACP integration). 982f89†L1-L10F:vtcode-core/src/ui/tui/session.rs†L1-L160F:src/agent/runloop/unified/turn.rs†L1-L200F:src/acp/zed.rs†L1-L200
-   **Opportunities**: Introduce layered module boundaries, extract reusable services, and codify naming/documentation standards to improve maintainability and onboarding speed.

## Architecture Overview

### Workspace Structure

-   Workspace is a two-crate Rust project: CLI binary (`vtcode`) depends on the `vtcode-core` library; workspace members declared in root `Cargo.toml`. F:Cargo.toml†L1-L61
-   Entry point parses CLI arguments, loads configuration, and dispatches subcommands to domain-specific handlers. F:src/main.rs†L5-L145

### Core Library (`vtcode-core`)

-   **Configuration system**: Centralized provider metadata and model identifiers defined in `config/models.rs`, guarding against hardcoded strings and exposing provider capabilities. F:vtcode-core/src/config/models.rs†L1-L207
-   **LLM providers**: Concrete integrations (e.g., OpenRouter) implement streaming, tool-call handling, and reasoning trace reconciliation atop a shared provider trait. F:vtcode-core/src/llm/providers/openrouter.rs†L1-L120
-   **Agent runtime**: `core/agent/runner.rs` coordinates tool registries, MCP clients, and thread events for specialized agent runs. F:vtcode-core/src/core/agent/runner.rs†L1-L170
-   **Terminal UI**: `ui/tui/session.rs` implements Ratatui-based rendering, modal handling, and inline command UI, but concentrates significant UI state in a single file. F:vtcode-core/src/ui/tui/session.rs†L1-L160

### CLI Binary (`src/`)

-   **Runloop**: `agent/runloop/unified/turn.rs` manages conversation phases, model selection, tool invocation, and UI orchestration per turn. F:src/agent/runloop/unified/turn.rs†L1-L200
-   **ACP Integration**: `acp/zed.rs` bridges Zed’s Agent Client Protocol with VT Code’s tool registry and permission flows. F:src/acp/zed.rs†L1-L200

## Codebase Health Snapshot

-   Repository contains ~95k lines of Rust across first-party and vendored crates; single largest file is generated MCP types (6.7k LOC). Large application modules include the TUI session (4.3k LOC), unified turn loop (3.3k LOC), and ACP integration (2.6k LOC). 982f89†L1-L10
-   Vendored MCP schema (`third-party/mcp-types`) is regenerated code; while large, it is mechanically derived and rarely edited, but still adds compile-time weight. F:third-party/mcp-types/src/v2024_11_05/types.rs†L1-L120
-   Core runtime modules couple many responsibilities (UI rendering, tool orchestration, configuration I/O), making them harder to test and reuse. F:src/agent/runloop/unified/turn.rs†L1-L200F:vtcode-core/src/ui/tui/session.rs†L1-L160

F:vtcode-core/src/ui/tui/session.rs†L1-L160       | Steep learning curve; difficult to unit-test or switch UI backends.                                                 |
| `src/agent/runloop/unified/turn.rs`           | Manages context curation, tool routing, theme selection, archive navigation, and MCP events in a single turn loop. F:src/agent/runloop/unified/turn.rs†L1-L200 | Hard to reason about turn lifecycles; increases risk of regressions when adding features.                           |
| `src/acp/zed.rs`                              | Bundles protocol negotiation, permission prompts, workspace trust sync, and tool registry plumbing. F:src/acp/zed.rs†L1-L200                                   | Limits reuse for other ACP clients; challenging to stub for integration tests.                                      |
| `vtcode-core/src/llm/providers/openrouter.rs` | Contains streaming assembly, tool-call normalization, and reasoning trace stitching. F:vtcode-core/src/llm/providers/openrouter.rs†L1-L120                     | Difficult to isolate provider-specific bugs; lacks clear boundary between HTTP client, adapters, and stream parser. |
| `vtcode-core/src/config/models.rs`            | Macro-generated OpenRouter catalog spans hundreds of entries within same file. F:vtcode-core/src/config/models.rs†L19-L119                                     | Editing model lists is error-prone; code review friction from large diffs.                                          |

-   [x] Capture regression tests for existing UI behaviors (fuzzy search, modal transitions) prior to moving code to new modules.F:vtcode-core/src/ui/tui/session.rs†L1-L160
-   [x] Extract modal and list management into `ui/tui/modal.rs` and related helpers, leaving `session.rs` as a coordinator over composed components.F:vtcode-core/src/ui/tui/session.rs†L37-L140
-   [x] Introduce a command palette/search module with isolated filtering/highlighting logic and dedicated unit tests.
    -   Implemented the slash palette state machine with prefix-aware highlighting and wraparound navigation tests, letting the session delegate rendering and suggestion updates to the shared helper.
    -   Centralized slash command prefix and range parsing inside the palette helper so the session reuses the shared utilities, backed by unit tests for cursor edge cases.
    -   Extended the shared slash palette to drive paging and home/end navigation shortcuts, ensuring the session defers all keyboard handling to the helper with dedicated coverage.
    -   Introduced shared fuzzy search utilities and richer slash command ranking so palette suggestions stay relevant for substring and keyword matches beyond simple prefixes.
-   [x] Split unified turn loop into state management, UI interaction, and tool routing submodules with clear API boundaries.F:src/agent/runloop/unified/state.rs†L1-L58F:src/agent/runloop/unified/ui_interaction.rs†L1-L223F:src/agent/runloop/unified/tool_routing.rs†L1-L142F:src/agent/runloop/unified/turn.rs†L1-L120

    -   Hoisted the ACP tool declarations and capability gating into `acp/tooling.rs`, exposing a `ToolRegistryProvider` contract so tests can substitute registry behaviour without touching the Zed adapter.F:src/acp/tooling.rs†L1-L420F:src/acp/zed.rs†L330-L420
    -   Moved permission prompt orchestration to `acp/permissions.rs`, implementing an `AcpPermissionPrompter` that emits consistent telemetry and is injected into `ZedAgent` through an `Rc` handle.F:src/acp/permissions.rs†L1-L136F:src/acp/zed.rs†L823-L908
    -   Wrapped the workspace trust handshake behind `DefaultWorkspaceTrustSynchronizer` so the adapter depends on an interface instead of the free function, easing future test doubles.F:src/acp/workspace.rs†L1-L31F:src/acp/zed.rs†L271-L310
    -   Centralized tool execution reporting constants in `acp/reports.rs` and refactored the Zed adapter to consume the shared helpers while keeping tool responses intact.F:src/acp/reports.rs†L1-L69F:src/acp/zed.rs†L920-L1305
-   [x] Add integration tests that replay ACP message flows using mocks to validate the refactored adapters.

    -   Generated OpenRouter constants and aliases at build time, including vendor-scoped slices (`config::models::openrouter::vendor::<slug>::MODELS`) to simplify downstream lookups.F:vtcode-core/src/config/constants.rs†L100-L200
    -   Fixed the generated metadata module to qualify `ModelId` and `OpenRouterMetadata` through `super::`, allowing the nested include to compile without missing type errors.F:vtcode-core/build.rs†L232-L339
    -   Restored runtime dependencies (`rmcp`, `mcp-types`, and `tokenizers`) to the main crate manifest and derived the OpenRouter tool availability list directly from JSON metadata so function-calling guards compile under the new generation pipeline.F:vtcode-core/Cargo.toml†L28-L120F:vtcode-core/build.rs†L1-L320
-   [x] Harden Windows startups by enforcing process mitigations that disable dynamic code, extension points, and untrusted image loads before the CLI continues.F:src/process_hardening.rs†L1-L120

    -   Updated the OpenRouter provider to consult the new metadata when gating reasoning effort and tool use so the generated tables stay in sync with runtime behaviour.F:vtcode-core/src/llm/providers/openrouter.rs†L740-L860

## Code Quality & Best Practice Strategies

-   **Consistent naming**: Enforce snake_case for functions/variables and PascalCase for types through Clippy and CI; document conventions in CONTRIBUTING. F:AGENTS.md†L96-L128
-   **Documentation**: Ensure public APIs and newly extracted modules include Rustdoc comments and update relevant docs under `./docs/`. F:AGENTS.md†L165-L193
-   **Separation of concerns**: Keep configuration parsing, command dispatch, and UI rendering in distinct crates/modules to preserve testability. F:Cargo.toml†L1-L103F:src/main.rs†L5-L145
-   **Testing strategy**: Expand unit and integration tests around newly factored components; leverage existing `tests/` harness and encourage scenario-based testing for turn loop and ACP flows.
-   **Performance monitoring**: Profile large modules after refactors (e.g., `cargo test`, criterion benchmarks) to ensure decompositions maintain throughput.
-   **Vendored code management**: Automate MCP schema updates and document regeneration steps to keep third-party code isolated from manual edits. F:third-party/mcp-types/src/v2024_11_05/types.rs†L1-L120

## Next Steps

-   Prioritize creation of module-level design docs for refactored components.
-   Establish coding guidelines for contributions (naming, formatting, module structure) and link them from README/CONTRIBUTING.
