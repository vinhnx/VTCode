Execute a comprehensive, line-by-line audit of the entire codebase to systematically identify and resolve optimization opportunities, prioritizing efficiency, scalability, and maintainability. Rigorously enforce the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by detecting and eliminating all duplicated or redundant logic, consolidating patterns into reusable, modular components. Validate strict alignment between agent loops, tool calls, and system prompts, ensuring consistency in logic flow, error handling, and state management. Refactor the agent harness and core execution logic to enforce autonomous yet safe tool execution, incorporating robust validation, fallback mechanisms, and rate-limiting. Adhere to best practices regarding modular design, separation of concerns, and minimal dependency overhead. Exclude all non-code deliverables—such as summaries or documentation—and output only the fully optimized, refactored code.

Conduct a comprehensive, line-by-line review of the entire codebase to systematically identify and prioritize optimization opportunities and enhancement areas, with a focus on maximizing efficiency, scalability, and maintainability. Ensure strict alignment between agent loops, tool calls, and system prompts by validating consistency in logic flow, error handling, and state management. Implement autonomous yet safe tool execution by enforcing robust validation, fallback mechanisms, and rate-limiting where applicable, while strictly adhering to agent coding best practices—including modular design, clear separation of concerns, and minimal dependency overhead. Exclude all non-code deliverables (e.g., summaries, documentation) and concentrate exclusively on refining the agent harness, tool integration, and core execution logic. Prioritize changes that reduce latency, improve reliability, and enhance adaptability without introducing unnecessary complexity.
