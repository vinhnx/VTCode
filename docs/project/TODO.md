the agent was able to use `rm` 


Run bash .. Timeout: 180 output

$ rm -rf /Users/vinhnguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/vtcode/target && sleep 2 && cargo clippy 2>&1 | head -n 200

rm: /Users/vinhnguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/vtcode/target/debug/.fingerprint: Directory not empty
rm: /Users/vinhnguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/vtcode/target/debug: Directory not empty
rm: /Users/vinhnguyenxuan/Developer/learn-by-doing/vtcode/target: Directory not empty
The lock file is being held by a previous process. Let me kill any cargo processes and try again.

-> for destructive commands, the vtcode agent should use human in the loop with persmission prompt
