Perform a comprehensive review and optimization of the vtcode agent harness, prioritizing execution speed, computational efficiency, context and token economy. Refactor the tool call architecture to minimize overhead and latency, while implementing robust error handling strategies to significantly reduce the agent's error rate and ensure reliable, effective performance.

---

Conduct a comprehensive review and enhancement of error handling and recovery mechanisms within the agent loop, with particular emphasis on tool call operations. Implement a multi-layered error handling strategy that includes retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures such as network timeouts, rate limiting, and temporary service unavailability while implementing fail-fast behavior for non-recoverable errors including authentication failures, invalid parameters, and permission denied scenarios. Develop and integrate a robust state management system that ensures the agent can maintain consistent internal state during and after error occurrences, including proper rollback mechanisms for partial operations and transaction-like semantics where appropriate. Create a comprehensive error categorization system that distinguishes between retryable and non-retryable errors and implements appropriate handling strategies for each category. Enhance user-facing error messages to be clear, actionable, and informative while avoiding technical jargon that may confuse end users. Implement proper logging at multiple levels including debug, info, warning, and error levels to facilitate troubleshooting and monitoring. Conduct a thorough audit of existing error handling implementations to identify gaps, inconsistencies, and potential failure points. Refactor the error handling code to improve modularity, testability, and maintainability while ensuring comprehensive test coverage for error scenarios including edge cases and unexpected inputs. Add appropriate circuit breaker patterns for external service calls to prevent cascading failures and enable graceful degradation when dependent services are unavailable. Implement proper resource cleanup and resource leak prevention throughout the agent loop.

Perform a comprehensive analysis of the codebase to identify and eliminate all instances of duplicated code, following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles. Conduct a systematic search across all modules, classes, and files to find similar code patterns, duplicate logic, redundant implementations, and opportunities for abstraction. Specifically examine rendering-related code such as diff previews and command output previews to determine if they can share unified rendering logic, styling, and common components. Audit all utility functions scattered throughout different modules and extract them into a centralized shared utility module with proper organization and documentation. Create a detailed report identifying each duplication found, the proposed refactoring strategy, and the expected benefits in terms of maintainability, reduced code complexity, and improved consistency. Ensure all refactored code maintains existing functionality while simplifying the overall architecture. Prioritize changes that provide the greatest reduction in duplication with minimal risk to existing functionality.

---

review any duplicated code in the codebase and refactor to remove duplication. For example, the logic for rendering the diff preview and the command output preview can be unified to use the same rendering logic and styling. This will make the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain. Additionally, any common utility functions that are duplicated across different modules can be extracted into a shared utility module. search across modules for similar code patterns and identify opportunities for refactoring to reduce duplication and improve code reuse.

auto-mode: this is the ideal permission UX. you don’t want claude to do dangerous stuff, and you don’t want to have to think about sandboxes and permissions every time you use a tool. auto-mode is a new permission mode that eliminates prompts by automatically granting the necessary permissions for each tool call based on the context and the user's preferences. This allows for a seamless and efficient user experience while maintaining safety and control.
