prompt Subagents
- ALWAYS wait for all subagents to complete before yielding.
- Spawn subagents automatically when:
- Parallelizable work (e.g., install + verify, npm test + typecheck, multiple tasks from plan)
- Long-running or blocking tasks where a worker can run independently.
  Isolation for risky changes or checks
