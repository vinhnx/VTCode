## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Now - Ready)
1.  Share [ANNOUNCEMENT.md](ANNOUNCEMENT.md) with team
2.  Point new developers to [README.md](README.md)
3.  Developers start using API from [MCP_MASTER_GUIDE.md](MCP_MASTER_GUIDE.md)
4.  Begin Phase 3 planning using roadmap

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
1. Start Phase 3 implementation (HTTP transport)
2. Implement error code system
3. Consider schema registry optimization (if needed)

### Documentation Maintenance
1. Keep [MCP_MASTER_GUIDE.md](MCP_MASTER_GUIDE.md) as single source of truth
2. Update phase status docs as progress is made
3. Archive old documents in archive/ when phases complete
