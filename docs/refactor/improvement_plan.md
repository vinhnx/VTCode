Updated VT-Code Agent Improvement Plan & TODO List

Based on the actual VTCode architecture from DeepWiki, here's a refined plan:

---

## 1. Context Management Enhancement

**Goal:** Make `SessionState` and context window management semantic and code-aware

### Current State Analysis

-   [x] Audit `enforce_unified_context_window()` in `src/agent/runloop/context.rs` - FOUND & REVIEWED
    -   Function already has semantic compression logic with `compute_semantic_scores()`
    -   Uses TreeSitterAnalyzer to extract code blocks and score symbols
    -   Supports `semantic_compression` and `tool_aware_retention` flags
    -   Cache mechanism for semantic scores already in place (hash-based)
-   [x] Review how `SessionState` currently manages message history
    -   Located in `src/agent/runloop/unified/session_setup.rs`
    -   Stores `conversation_history: Vec<uni::Message>` with trim_config
    -   Has `token_budget` for tracking context usage
-   [x] Analyze token counting vs semantic importance weighting
    -   Uses `approximate_unified_message_tokens()` for token counting (char-based approximation)
    -   Semantic scores: 0-255 u8 scale based on code structure (functions=6, classes=8, etc.)
    -   Tool responses get +2 bonus to priority
-   [x] Map TreeSitterAnalyzer usage in context decisions
    -   Already integrated with language detection and symbol extraction
    -   Supports Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Java, Bash, Swift

### Core Implementation

#### **Semantic Context Compression**

-   [ ] **Integrate TreeSitterAnalyzer into context pruning**

    -   [ ] Modify `enforce_unified_context_window()` to preserve structural boundaries
    -   [ ] Add semantic importance scoring for code blocks in messages
    -   [ ] Ensure function signatures, class definitions aren't split mid-structure
    -   [ ] Weight recently-accessed structural nodes higher than chronological age

-   [ ] **Tool-aware context retention**
    -   [ ] Track active tool type (TreeSitterAnalyzer, ast_grep, file_ops)
    -   [ ] Extend `SessionState` to tag messages with originating tool
    -   [ ] Keep tool results in context longer when that tool is actively being used
    -   [ ] Example: `ast_grep_search` results stay in context during structural refactoring

#### **Differential Context Loading**

-   [ ] **Smart file content loading**
    -   [ ] When FileOpsTool reads a file, use TreeSitterAnalyzer to extract structure
    -   [ ] Send only relevant functions/classes + surrounding context
    -   [ ] Cache structural analysis to avoid re-parsing same files
    -   [ ] Add config option: `context.semantic_diff_mode = true`

### Configuration Extensions

```toml
# New section in vtcode.toml
[context]
semantic_compression = true
tool_aware_retention = true
max_structural_depth = 3  # How many AST levels to preserve
preserve_recent_tools = 5  # Keep last N tool results
```

### Testing

-   [ ] Benchmark: tokens saved with semantic compression on large codebases
-   [ ] Test: multi-file refactoring preserves necessary context
-   [ ] Measure: reduced "I don't see X in context" errors

---

## 2. Security & Tool Policy Enhancement

**Goal:** Scale `ToolPolicyGateway` with dynamic risk assessment while maintaining workspace trust

### Current State Analysis

-   [ ] Review `ToolPolicyGateway` implementation in `vtcode-core/src/tools/registry.rs`
-   [ ] Document current Allow/Deny/Prompt policy logic
-   [ ] Map workspace trust level checking
-   [ ] Analyze CommandTool and PtyManager security boundaries

### Dynamic Risk Scoring Layer

#### **Enhance ToolPolicyGateway**

-   [ ] **Add risk scoring system**

    ```rust
    pub struct ToolRiskContext {
        tool_name: String,
        source: ToolSource, // Internal, MCP, ACP
        workspace_trust: TrustLevel,
        recent_approvals: usize,
        command_args: Vec<String>,
    }

    pub enum RiskLevel { Low, Medium, High, Critical }

    impl ToolPolicyGateway {
        fn calculate_risk(&self, ctx: &ToolRiskContext) -> RiskLevel;
        fn requires_justification(&self, risk: RiskLevel) -> bool;
    }
    ```

-   [ ] **Request provenance tracking**
    -   [ ] Distinguish LocalToolRegistry vs AcpToolRegistry vs MCP tools
    -   [ ] Higher risk for MCP/external tools vs built-in tools
    -   [ ] Track tool call chain (which tool called which)

#### **Conditional Auto-Approval**

-   [ ] **Low-risk bypass logic**

    -   [ ] Auto-approve `read_file` in trusted workspaces
    -   [ ] Auto-approve TreeSitterAnalyzer (always safe, read-only)
    -   [ ] Auto-approve `grep_search` (no writes)
    -   [ ] Log all auto-approved actions to `~/.vtcode/audit.log`

-   [ ] **Agent justification for high-risk tools**
    -   [ ] Before showing Prompt policy dialog, ask LLM to justify
    -   [ ] Add system prompt: "Explain why you need to run this command"
    -   [ ] Show justification in TUI approval dialog
    -   [ ] Store approval decisions to learn patterns

#### **MCP-Specific Security**

-   [ ] Since MCP integration is mentioned, add MCP-specific policies
-   [ ] Tag all MCP tool calls with external source marker
-   [ ] Require explicit approval for first use of any MCP tool
-   [ ] Allow "trust this MCP server for session" option

### Configuration Extensions

```toml
[security]
enable_dynamic_risk_scoring = true
auto_approve_readonly = true
require_justification_threshold = "high"  # medium, high, critical
audit_log_path = "~/.vtcode/audit.log"

[security.trusted_workspaces]
"/path/to/my/project" = "high"
"/tmp/*" = "low"
```

### Implementation Files

-   [ ] Extend `vtcode-core/src/tools/registry.rs` with risk scoring
-   [ ] Update `vtcode-core/src/tools/command_tool.rs` with justification logic
-   [ ] Add `vtcode-core/src/tools/risk_scorer.rs` new module
-   [ ] Modify TUI approval dialogs in `vtcode-core/src/ui/` to show justifications

### Testing

-   [ ] Security audit: ensure high-risk commands still require approval
-   [ ] UX test: measure reduction in unnecessary approval prompts
-   [ ] Test malicious payload detection in risk scoring
-   [ ] Verify audit log captures all tool executions

---

## 3. LLM Provider Abstraction Enhancement

**Goal:** Support provider-specific features without breaking `LLMProvider` trait

### Current State Analysis

-   [ ] Review `LLMProvider` trait in `vtcode-core/src/llm/provider.rs`
-   [ ] Document current `LLMRequest`/`LLMResponse` structure
-   [ ] Map provider-specific translation logic (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini)
-   [ ] Check `LLMFactory::create_provider_for_model()` instantiation

### Extension Trait Architecture

#### **Design Optional Capability Traits**

```rust
// vtcode-core/src/llm/capabilities.rs (new module)

/// Optional: Structured output with schema guarantees
#[async_trait]
pub trait StructuredOutputProvider: LLMProvider {
    async fn generate_structured(
        &self,
        request: LLMRequest,
        schema: JsonSchema,
    ) -> Result<(String, Value)>; // (text, validated_json)
}

/// Optional: Advanced reasoning controls
#[async_trait]
pub trait AdvancedReasoningProvider: LLMProvider {
    fn supports_chain_of_thought(&self) -> bool;
    fn with_reasoning_mode(&mut self, mode: ReasoningMode);
}

/// Optional: Extended context window features
#[async_trait]
pub trait ExtendedContextProvider: LLMProvider {
    fn effective_context_size(&self) -> usize;
    fn supports_context_caching(&self) -> bool;
}
```

#### **Capability Detection System**

### Agent Integration

-   [ ] **Conditional feature usage in Agent**
    ```rust
    impl Agent {
        async fn execute_tool_with_structured_output(&self, tool: ToolCall) {
            if let Some(structured) = self.provider.as_any()
                .downcast_ref::<dyn StructuredOutputProvider>() {
                // Use guaranteed structured output
            } else {
                // Fall back to parsing LLM text
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### Configuration Extensions

```toml
[llm]
prefer_structured_output = true  # Use if provider supports it
enable_advanced_reasoning = true # For o1/reasoning models

---

## Quick Start: Pick One Area

If you want to start immediately, I recommend **Phase 1: Complete Integration** because:

1. It directly improves user experience in every session
2. It touches core architecture (`SessionState`, `Agent`)
3. It leverages existing TreeSitterAnalyzer without adding dependencies
4. Results are immediately measurable (token usage, context retention)

**Goal:** Hook ToolResultCache into the tool execution pipeline for performance optimization

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (Nov 11, 2025 - 18:15)

**What was implemented:**
- [x] Identified read-only tools: `read_file`, `list_files`, `grep_search`, `find_files`, `tree_sitter_analyze`
- [x] ToolResultCache passed to and integrated in tool execution pipeline
- [x] Cache checking implemented BEFORE executing read-only tools (session.rs:1364-1381)
- [x] Results cached AFTER successful execution (session.rs:1397-1407)
- [x] Cache invalidation on file modifications (session.rs:1521-1525)
- [x] No separate metrics logging needed - ToolResultCache already has stats()

**Implementation Details:**

**File: `src/agent/runloop/unified/turn/session.rs`**

1. **Read-only tool classification** (lines 1328-1335):
   - Matches: `read_file`, `list_files`, `grep_search`, `find_files`, `tree_sitter_analyze`

2. **Cache lookup before execution** (lines 1364-1381):
   - Creates `CacheKey` from tool name and JSON parameters
   - Checks `tool_result_cache.get()` for existing results
   - Returns cached result directly if TTL still valid
   - Debug logs cache hits

3. **Result caching after execution** (lines 1397-1407):
   - For successful tool runs, serializes output to JSON string
   - Stores in cache with LRU eviction

4. **Cache invalidation on file changes** (lines 1521-1525):
   - When user applies modified files, iterates through all changed paths
   - Calls `cache.invalidate_for_path(file_path)` to clear stale results

**Build Status:**
- ✅ `cargo check` passes (only pre-existing warnings)
- ✅ `cargo test --lib` passes (14 tests)

- [x] Integrated SearchMetrics into SessionState
- [x] Complete test coverage (9 tests, all passing)

**Implementation Details:**

**File: `vtcode-core/src/tools/search_metrics.rs`** (290+ LOC)

1. **SearchMetric struct** - Records individual search operations:

2. **SearchMetrics tracker** - Aggregates search operations:
   - `record_search()` - Log a completed search with token estimation
   - `expensive_searches()` - Find high-token-cost searches
   - `slowest_searches()` - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - `should_sample_results()` - Check if search needs sampling
   - `estimate_sampling_ratio()` - Calculate intelligent sampling rate (10-100%)
