# MCP Integration Guide

This guide outlines how VT Code connects to external MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, how
allowlists control tool access, and how to troubleshoot common configuration issues.

## Configuring MCP Providers

1. Open `vtcode.toml` and ensure the global MCP section is enabled:

   ```toml
   [mcp]
   enabled = true
   max_concurrent_connections = 3
   request_timeout_seconds = 45
   retry_attempts = 2
   ```

2. Configure the MCP UI panel if desired:

   ```toml
   [mcp.ui]
   mode = "compact"
   max_events = 25
   show_provider_names = false
   ```

3. Define one or more providers. Stdio transports embed the command, arguments, and optional
   working directory directly in the provider table:

   ```toml
   [[mcp.providers]]
   name = "time"
   enabled = true
   command = "uvx"
   args = ["mcp-server-time"]
   max_concurrent_requests = 2
   ```

   For HTTP transports, specify the endpoint and headers in place of the stdio fields. The
   configuration loader automatically deserializes either transport variant.

4. Tune handshake behaviour and tool execution deadlines when working with slower MCP servers.
   VT Code mirrors the Codex CLI guidance for Model Context Protocol clients by exposing the same
   timeout controls described in the reference configuration:

   ```toml
   [mcp]
   startup_timeout_seconds = 90   # optional: time allowed for provider startup/handshake
   tool_timeout_seconds = 45      # optional: time allowed for individual tool calls
   experimental_use_rmcp_client = true
   ```

   - `startup_timeout_seconds` applies to the initial handshake. Setting it to `0` disables the
     timeout and is useful when launching large stdio servers that pull dependencies on demand.
   - `tool_timeout_seconds` bounds list and call operations. When omitted, VT Code falls back to the
     legacy `request_timeout_seconds` value for backwards compatibility.
   - `experimental_use_rmcp_client` toggles the RMCP transport introduced in the Codex MCP
     documentation. It defaults to `true` so streamable HTTP servers, including those that require
     bearer tokens or OAuth flows, remain available without extra configuration.

## Allowlist Behaviour

MCP access is gated by pattern-based allowlists. The defaults apply to every provider unless the
provider supplies its own patterns. Provider-specific rules now fully override the defaults:

- When a provider defines `tools`, `resources`, `prompts`, or `logging` patterns, only matches in
  that provider block are accepted. Default rules are ignored for that provider.
- If a provider omits a rule set, VT Code falls back to the default patterns.
- Configuration permissions (`configuration` maps) continue to support provider overrides via an
  explicit match or by delegating to the default rules.

This behaviour avoids situations where a restrictive provider configuration is silently bypassed by
broader default patterns.

### Example

```toml
[mcp.allowlist.default]
resources = ["docs/*"]

[mcp.allowlist.providers.context7]
resources = ["journals/*"]
```

In this configuration:

- `context7` can access only `journals/*` resources.
- Other providers continue to match `docs/*` through the default rule.

## Testing the Integration

Run the MCP-focused test suite to verify configuration parsing, allowlist enforcement, and registry
wiring:

```bash
cargo test -p vtcode-core mcp -- --nocapture
```

The suite includes mocked clients and parsing tests so it does not require live MCP servers. For
an end-to-end check against the Context7 MCP server, invoke the ignored smoke test which spawns the
official `@upstash/context7-mcp` package on demand:

```bash
cargo test -p vtcode-core --test mcp_context7_manual context7_list_tools_smoke -- --ignored --nocapture
```

Expect the test to take a little longer on the first run while `npx` downloads the server bundle.

## Troubleshooting

- **Unexpected tool execution permissions** – confirm whether the provider defines its own
  allowlist. Provider rules now override defaults, so missing patterns may block tools that defaults
  would otherwise allow.
- **Provider handshake visibility** – VT Code now sends explicit MCP client metadata and
  normalizes structured tool responses. Context7 results surface as plain JSON objects in the
  tool panel so downstream renderers can display status, metadata, and message lists without
  additional post-processing.
- **Stale configuration values** – ensure `max_concurrent_connections`, `request_timeout_seconds`,
  and `retry_attempts` appear under the `[mcp]` table *after* any nested `[mcp.ui]` section. TOML
  resets the table context when a new header appears.
- **HTTP transport issues** – VT Code currently performs capability probing for HTTP MCP servers but
  requires a streaming implementation to be fully functional. Use stdio transports when possible.

With these settings and checks in place, MCP providers and allowlists should behave predictably,
unlocking additional context-aware tooling in VT Code.
