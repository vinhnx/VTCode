# Extracted Crates Release Plan

This document aligns the release process for the extracted VTCode crates so the first
publishes to crates.io land smoothly and downstream consumers receive consistent
versioning, changelog, and documentation updates.

## Release scope
- `vtcode-commons`
- `vtcode-markdown-store`
- `vtcode-indexer`
- `vtcode-bash-runner`
- `vtcode-exec-events`

Each crate already re-exports back through `vtcode-core`, so the release cadence must
keep the workspace dependency graph coherent.

## Versioning strategy
1. Cut an initial **`0.1.0`** release for every extracted crate.
   - Align on the same minor version to signal that the crates are being published
     together as part of the extraction effort.
   - Use semantic versioning: breaking changes increment the minor version while
     additive changes bump the patch version during the 0.x series.
2. Tag the workspace with `vtcode-<crate>-v0.1.0` Git tags for each publish so
   downstream consumers can trace source history per crate.
3. Update `vtcode-core` dependency constraints to the released versions immediately
   after each publish to keep the workspace build reproducible.

## Changelog updates
1. Add crate-specific sections to `CHANGELOG.md` highlighting:
   - The initial release summary (new crate, primary capabilities, feature flags).
   - Notable differences versus the in-tree implementations (e.g., configurable
     storage, policy hooks, examples).
2. Include links back to the relevant documentation in `docs/` for quick reference
   (e.g., `docs/vtcode_indexer.md`, `docs/vtcode_bash_runner.md`).
3. Cross-link the changelog entries from crate-level README files once they exist
   to provide a consistent upgrade path for users discovering the crate directly on
   crates.io or docs.rs.

## Documentation refresh
1. Regenerate API docs with `cargo doc --no-deps --all-features -p <crate>` prior to
   publishing. Manually inspect rendered docs for broken intra-doc links or missing
   examples.
2. Ensure each crate README references the component extraction roadmap and the new
   release plan so contributors can follow future milestones.
3. Update `docs/component_extraction_plan.md` and `docs/component_extraction_todo.md`
   to reflect the completed milestones and include pointers to the release plan.

## Publication checklist
1. Run the full validation suite in CI and locally:
   - `cargo fmt`
   - `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`
   - `cargo nextest run --workspace`
2. Bump crate versions in their respective `Cargo.toml` files and run `cargo check`
   to confirm lockfile updates compile.
3. Use `cargo publish --dry-run -p <crate>` for each crate to catch manifest or
   packaging issues (missing files, license metadata).
4. Publish crates sequentially, starting with shared dependencies (`vtcode-commons`,
   `vtcode-markdown-store`) followed by dependents (`vtcode-indexer`,
   `vtcode-bash-runner`, `vtcode-exec-events`).
5. After each publish, push the git tags and open a PR updating the workspace to the
   released versions (including regenerated lockfiles and changelog entries).

## Post-release follow-up
- Monitor crates.io download metrics and GitHub issues for early adopter feedback.
- Schedule a follow-up milestone to evaluate extracting additional crates (`vtcode-llm`,
  `vtcode-tools`, `vtcode-config`) once the initial batch stabilizes.
- Keep the release plan updated as workflows evolve (e.g., adding automation via
  `cargo release` or GitHub Actions publishing steps).
