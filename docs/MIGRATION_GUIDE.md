# Migration Guide: Modular Tools System

## Overview

The tools system has been refactored from a monolithic 3371-line file into a clean modular architecture. **All existing code continues to work without changes.**

## What Changed

### Before (Monolithic)
```
tools_legacy.rs - 3371 lines
 Mixed tool implementations
 Complex interdependencies
 Single large file
```

### After (Modular)
```
tools/
 mod.rs           # Clean exports
 traits.rs        # Composability traits
 types.rs         # Common types
 grep_file.rs     # Ripgrep-backed search manager
 file_ops.rs      # File operations
 command.rs       # Command execution
 registry.rs      # Tool coordination
```

## Backward Compatibility

**All existing tool calls work unchanged**
**Same function signatures and return types**
**No migration required for existing code**

## Enhanced Capabilities

### Search Consolidation
Search functionality is now centred on a single component:

-   `grep_file.rs` – manages debounced ripgrep execution with perg fallback and workspace-aware filtering

### Usage Example

```rust
// Grep search (unchanged entry point)
let args = serde_json::json!({
    "pattern": "fn new",
    "path": "src",
    "case_sensitive": false,
});
let result = tool_registry.execute("grep_file", args).await?;
```

## For Developers

### Adding New Tools
1. Implement the `Tool` trait
2. Optionally implement `ModeTool` for multiple modes
3. Optionally implement `CacheableTool` for caching
4. Register in `ToolRegistry`

### Best Practices
- Use trait-based design for composability
- Implement multiple modes when beneficial
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include caching for expensive operations
- Maintain backward compatibility

## Benefits Delivered

- **77% complexity reduction** (3371 → ~800 lines)
- **Enhanced functionality** through mode-based execution
- **Better maintainability** with clear module boundaries
- **Improved testability** with isolated components
- **Future extensibility** through trait-based design

## No Action Required

Existing code continues to work without any changes. The modular architecture provides a foundation for future enhancements while maintaining full compatibility.
