###  URLs with Credentials in Query Parameters

```
  https://api.example.com?api_key=sk_live_1234567890abcdef
   Reason: URL contains sensitive pattern 'api_key='. Fetching URLs with 
           credentials or sensitive data is blocked

  https://example.com?password=MySecretPassword123
   Reason: URL contains sensitive pattern 'password='. Fetching URLs with 
           credentials or sensitive data is blocked

  https://example.com?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   Reason: URL contains sensitive pattern 'token='. Fetching URLs with 
           credentials or sensitive data is blocked

  https://database.example.com?session=abc123xyz
   Reason: URL contains sensitive pattern 'session='. Fetching URLs with 
           credentials or sensitive data is blocked

  https://api.example.com?oauth=...
   Reason: URL contains sensitive pattern 'oauth'. Fetching URLs with 
           credentials or sensitive data is blocked
```

###  URLs with Sensitive Paths

```
  https://example.com/admin/dashboard
   Reason: URL contains sensitive pattern '/admin'. Fetching URLs with 
           credentials or sensitive data is blocked

  https://example.com/private/files
   Reason: URL contains sensitive pattern '/private'. Fetching URLs with 
           credentials or sensitive data is blocked

  https://example.com/internal/api
   Reason: URL contains sensitive pattern '/internal'. Fetching URLs with 
           credentials or sensitive data is blocked

  https://example.com/secret/config
   Reason: URL contains sensitive pattern '/secret'. Fetching URLs with 
           credentials or sensitive data is blocked
```

###  Malware & Phishing Indicators

```
  https://suspicious-site.com/download/file.exe
   Reason: URL contains potentially malicious pattern. Access blocked for safety

  https://suspicious-site.com/malware.bat
   Reason: URL contains potentially malicious pattern. Access blocked for safety

  https://suspicious-site.com/script.ps1
   Reason: URL contains potentially malicious pattern. Access blocked for safety

  https://g00gle.com/search
   Reason: URL contains potentially malicious pattern. Access blocked for safety
   (This is a typosquatting domain mimicking Google)

  https://micr0soft.com/download
   Reason: URL contains potentially malicious pattern. Access blocked for safety
   (This is a typosquatting domain mimicking Microsoft)

  https://gooogle.com
   Reason: URL contains potentially malicious pattern. Access blocked for safety
   (This is a typosquatting domain mimicking Google)

  https://facebk.com
   Reason: URL contains potentially malicious pattern. Access blocked for safety
   (This is a typosquatting domain mimicking Facebook)

  https://amaz0n.com/products
   Reason: URL contains potentially malicious pattern. Access blocked for safety
   (This is a typosquatting domain mimicking Amazon)
```

###  URL Shorteners (Security Risk)

```
  https://bit.ly/abc123xyz
   Reason: URL contains potentially malicious pattern. Access blocked for safety
   (URL shorteners can hide the actual destination)

  https://short.link/post/12345
   Reason: URL contains potentially malicious pattern. Access blocked for safety

  https://tinyurl.com/mylink
   Reason: URL contains potentially malicious pattern. Access blocked for safety

  https://goo.gl/abc123
   Reason: URL contains potentially malicious pattern. Access blocked for safety
```

###  Non-HTTPS & Private Network Access

```
  http://example.com
   Reason: Only HTTPS URLs are allowed for security

  https://localhost:8080
   Reason: Access to local/private networks is blocked

  https://127.0.0.1:3000
   Reason: Access to local/private networks is blocked

  https://0.0.0.0
   Reason: Access to local/private networks is blocked

  https://[::1]:5000
   Reason: Access to local/private networks is blocked

## Security Best Practices

###   DO:
- Use public documentation URLs
- Fetch from known, trusted public services
- Use URLs without any credentials
- Access public APIs with proper endpoint structure

###   DON'T:
- Embed API keys in URLs (use request headers instead)
- Include passwords in URLs
- Use URL shorteners (always use full URLs)
- Access local/private services from the web_fetch tool
- Use HTTP (always use HTTPS)
- Access sensitive personal or financial services

## Error Response Format

When a URL is blocked, you'll receive a JSON response with this format:

```json
{
  "error": "web_fetch: failed to fetch URL 'https://example.com': [REASON]",
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
```

**Example responses:**

```json
{
  "error": "web_fetch: failed to fetch URL 'https://paypal.com/login': Access to sensitive domain 'paypal.com' is blocked for privacy and security reasons",
  "url": "https://paypal.com/login"
}
```

```json
{
  "error": "web_fetch: failed to fetch URL 'https://example.com?password=secret': URL contains sensitive pattern 'password='. Fetching URLs with credentials or sensitive data is blocked",
  "url": "https://example.com?password=secret"
}
```

---

## Testing the Security

You can test these security measures by attempting to fetch blocked URLs:

```rust
// Test 1: Banking domain should be rejected
web_fetch("https://paypal.com/login", "Extract login form")

// Test 2: Credentials in URL should be rejected
web_fetch("https://api.example.com?api_key=sk_123", "Get data")

// Test 3: Typosquatting should be rejected
web_fetch("https://g00gle.com", "Search for something")

// Test 4: Safe URLs should be allowed
web_fetch("https://github.com/vinhnx/vtcode", "List repositories")
```
