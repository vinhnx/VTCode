## Security Best Practices

### ✓  DO:
- Use public documentation URLs
- Fetch from known, trusted public services
- Use URLs without any credentials
- Access public APIs with proper endpoint structure

### ⤫  DON'T:
- Embed API keys in URLs (use request headers instead)
- Include passwords in URLs
- Use URL shorteners (always use full URLs)
- Access local/private services from the web_fetch tool
- Use HTTP (always use HTTPS)
- Access sensitive personal or financial services

---

## Error Response Format

When a URL is blocked, you'll receive a JSON response with this format:

```json
{
  "error": "web_fetch: failed to fetch URL 'https://example.com': [REASON]",
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
```

**Example responses:**

```json
{
  "error": "web_fetch: failed to fetch URL 'https://paypal.com/login': Access to sensitive domain 'paypal.com' is blocked for privacy and security reasons",
  "url": "https://paypal.com/login"
}
```

```json
{
  "error": "web_fetch: failed to fetch URL 'https://example.com?password=secret': URL contains sensitive pattern 'password='. Fetching URLs with credentials or sensitive data is blocked",
  "url": "https://example.com?password=secret"
}
```

## Testing the Security

You can test these security measures by attempting to fetch blocked URLs:

```rust
// Test 1: Banking domain should be rejected
web_fetch("https://paypal.com/login", "Extract login form")

// Test 2: Credentials in URL should be rejected
web_fetch("https://api.example.com?api_key=sk_123", "Get data")

// Test 3: Typosquatting should be rejected
web_fetch("https://g00gle.com", "Search for something")

// Test 4: Safe URLs should be allowed
web_fetch("https://github.com/vinhnx/vtcode", "List repositories")
```
