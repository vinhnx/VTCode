# Release Process Documentation

This document explains how to create releases for the VT Code project, including changelog generation.

## Release Process

1. Ensure all changes are committed to the `main` branch
2. Run the release script:
    ```bash
    ./scripts/release.sh --minor|--major|--patch
    ```
3. The script will:
    - Bump versions in all workspace crates
    - Update dependencies between workspace crates
    - Create git commits and tags
    - Push changes to the remote repository
    - Publish to crates.io (unless --skip-crates is used)

## Changelog Generation

Changelog generation happens automatically when tags are pushed:

1. The release script creates a git tag (e.g., `v0.20.0`)
2. GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) is triggered
3. The workflow runs `changelogithub` which:
    - Analyzes git commits since the last tag
    - Groups commits by type (feat, fix, etc.) based on conventional commits
    - Updates `CHANGELOG.md` with new entries
    - Creates a GitHub Release with the changelog content

## Pre-release Versions

For pre-release versions, use:

```bash
./scripts/release.sh --pre-release
# or
./scripts/release.sh --pre-release-suffix beta.1
```

## Configuration

-   Changelog generation is configured in `.github/changelogithub.config.js`
-   Release process is configured in `release.toml`
-   The release script is in `scripts/release.sh`

## Conventional Commits

For changelog generation to work properly, commit messages should follow conventional commit format:

-   `feat: description` - New features (become "Features" in changelog)
-   `fix: description` - Bug fixes (become "Bug Fixes" in changelog)
-   `docs: description` - Documentation changes
-   etc.
