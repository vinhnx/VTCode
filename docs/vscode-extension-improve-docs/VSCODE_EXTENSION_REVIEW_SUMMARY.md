## 🛠️ Implementation Approach

### Recommended Strategy: Iterative Rollout

#### Week 1: Low-Risk Improvements
- Ship UI polish immediately
- Gain user feedback
- Establish testing patterns

#### Weeks 2-6: Architecture Work
- Refactor commands (feature-flagged)
- Implement participants
- Maintain backward compatibility

#### Weeks 7-12: New Features
- Conversation persistence
- Tool approval UI
- Error recovery

### Why This Works
1. **Early Wins**: Users see improvements quickly
2. **Parallel Work**: Architecture improvements don't block features
3. **Low Risk**: Each phase can be tested independently
4. **Feedback Loop**: Early user feedback informs later work

## ⚠️ Critical Success Factors

1. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Never break existing workflows
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Each phase needs >85% code coverage
3. **User Communication**: Keep users informed of improvements
4. **Phased Rollout**: Don't try to do everything at once
5. **Clear Documentation**: Help the team understand changes
6. **Frequent Releases**: Get feedback early and often

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

1. ❌ Rewrite extension.ts in one go
2. ❌ Break existing commands or configuration
3. ❌ Implement all features without user feedback
4. ❌ Skip testing to save time
5. ❌ Neglect documentation

---

## 📞 Questions & Clarifications

### "How long will this take?"
**Answer**: 12 weeks with 2 developers (1 primary, 1 support). Can be adjusted based on team size.

### "Will this break existing workflows?"
**Answer**: No. The roadmap maintains backward compatibility throughout. UI improvements can ship independently.

### "Can we do this incrementally?"
**Answer**: Yes! That's the whole point of the phased approach. Phase 1 improvements can ship immediately.

### "Do we need to rewrite everything?"
**Answer**: No. The improvements are additive and don't require a complete rewrite. extension.ts refactoring is internal only.

### "What if we only want Phase 1?"
**Answer**: Phase 1 improvements alone provide significant user value. Later phases are optional enhancements.
