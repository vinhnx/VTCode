3. Schedule kickoff meeting

---

##  Execution Quick Start

### Step 1: Setup (30 min)
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/phase1-ui-polish

# Set up testing
npm install --save-dev vitest

# Create directory structure
mkdir -p src/{types,commands,participants,chat,tools,ui,error}
```

### Step 2: First Task (2-3 days)

##  Code Review Checklist

Every PR should have:
- [ ] Tests (unit + integration)
- [ ] >85% code coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes
- [ ] Performance tested
- [ ] Accessibility checked
- [ ] Works on dark/light themes

##  Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1.   Trying to do everything at once
     Follow the phased approach

2.   Skipping tests to save time
     Tests provide confidence

3.   Breaking existing commands
     Maintain backward compatibility

4.   Neglecting documentation
     Documentation is part of the feature

5.   Not getting user feedback early
     Validate assumptions with users

6.   Complexity in Phase 2 architecture
     Keep it simple, iterate later

##  FAQ

**Q: Can we do this with fewer developers?**
A: Yes, it will just take longer. One developer can do it in 20-24 weeks.

**Q: What if we only want Phase 1?**
A: Phase 1 provides significant value and can ship independently.

**Q: Can we run phases in parallel?**
A: Partially. Phase 1 is independent, but Phase 2-4 have dependencies.

**Q: What happens if we skip Phase 2?**
A: Phase 3-4 will be harder since they depend on the architecture improvements.

**Q: How do we handle bugs found during Phase 2?**
A: They're fixed immediately but don't block phase completion.

**Q: Can users opt into beta features?**
A: Yes, we can feature-flag improvements during development.

**Q: What about performance impact?**
A: Phase 1 improves performance. Later phases are neutral to slightly better.

**Q: Will this break user configurations?**
A: No. We maintain backward compatibility throughout.
