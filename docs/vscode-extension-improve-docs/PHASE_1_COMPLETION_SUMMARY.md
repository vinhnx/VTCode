## Example Output

### Status Indicator Examples
```
 Ready
 Thinking...
 Streaming response... | 1s | 250 tokens | gpt-4
 Executing tools (2/5) | 45s
  Error occurred
```

### Error Message Examples
```
**Connection Failed**

VTCode cannot connect to the backend service. The service may be starting 
up or encountered an issue.

 **Suggestion:** Try again in a few moments. If the problem persists, 
restart the extension.

---

**Token Limit Exceeded**

Your message or conversation context is too large for the current model. 
The AI ran out of tokens to process your request.

 **Suggestion:** Try a shorter message or start a new conversation. You 
can also simplify your context.
```
