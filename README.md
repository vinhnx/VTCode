**VT Code** is a Rust-based terminal coding agent with semantic code intelligence via Tree-sitter (parsers for Rust, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Java) and ast-grep (structural pattern matching and refactoring).

It supports multiple LLM providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, OpenRouter, all with automatic failover, prompt caching, and token-efficient context management. Configuration occurs entirely through `vtcode.toml`, sourcing constants from `vtcode-core/src/config/constants.rs` and model IDs from `docs/models.json` to ensure reproducibility and avoid hardcoding.

## Technical Motivation

VT Code addresses limitations in existing coding agents by prioritizing Rust's type safety, zero-cost abstractions, and async ecosystem for reliable, high-performance execution. Motivated by agentic AI research (e.g., Anthropic's context engineering principles), it integrates Tree-sitter for precise parsing and MCP for extensible tooling. This enables long-running sessions with maintained context integrity, error resilience, and minimal token overhead. Builds on foundational work like [perg](https://crates.io/crates/perg) while incorporating lessons from Anthropic's [Context Engineering](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents) and [Building effective agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) guide. Inspiration from OpenAI's [codex-cli](https://github.com/openai/codex).

## System Architecture

The architecture divides into `vtcode-core` (reusable library) and `src/` (CLI executable), leveraging Tokio for multi-threaded async runtime (`#[tokio::main(flavor = "multi_thread")]` for CPU-intensive tasks), anyhow for contextual error propagation, and clap for derive-based CLI parsing. Key design tenets include atomic operations, metadata-driven tool calls (to optimize context tokens), and phase-aware context curation.

### Core Components (`vtcode-core/`)

-   **LLM Abstractions (`llm/`)**:
    Provider traits enable uniform async interfaces:

    ```rust
    #[async_trait::async_trait]
    pub trait Provider: Send + Sync {
        async fn complete(&self, prompt: &str) -> anyhow::Result<Completion>;
        fn supports_caching(&self) -> bool;
    }
    ```

    Features: Streaming responses, model-specific optimizations (e.g., Anthropic's `cache_control: { ttl: "5m" }` for 5-minute TTL; OpenAI's `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` reporting ~40% savings). Tokenization via `tiktoken-rs` ensures accurate budgeting across models.

-   **Modular Tools (`tools/`)**:
    Trait-based extensibility:

    ```rust
    #[async_trait]
    pub trait Tool: Send + Sync {
        fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
        fn description(&self) -> &'static str;
        async fn execute(&self, args: serde_json::Value) -> anyhow::Result<serde_json::Value>;
    }
    ```

    Built-ins include `read_file` (chunked at 2000 lines, metadata-first), `ast_grep_search` (operations: search/transform/lint/refactor with preview_only=true), and `run_terminal_cmd` (modes: terminal/pty/streaming; 30s timeout default). Git integration via `list_files` uses `walkdir` with `ignore` crate for .gitignore-aware traversal and `nucleo-matcher` for fuzzy scoring.

-   **Configuration Engine (`config/`)**:
    Deserializes `vtcode.toml` into structs with validation:

    ```toml
    [context.curation]
    enabled = true
    max_tokens_per_turn = 100000  # Enforce per-provider limits
    phase_detection = true  # Auto-classify: exploration/implementation/etc.
    ```

    Sections cover agents, tools (allow/deny), MCP (provider URLs), caching (quality_threshold=0.7), and safety (workspace_paths, max_file_size=1MB).

-   **Context Engineering System**:
    Implements iterative, per-turn curation based on conversation phase detection (e.g., exploration prioritizes search tools). Token budgeting: Real-time tracking with `tiktoken-rs` (~10μs/message), thresholds (0.75 warn/0.85 compact), and automatic summarization (LLM-driven, preserving decision ledger and errors; targets 30% compression ratio, saving ~29% tokens/turn). Decision ledger: Structured audit (`Vec<DecisionEntry>` with status: pending/in_progress/completed, confidence: 0-1). Error recovery: Pattern matching (e.g., parse failures) with fallback strategies and context preservation.

-   **Code Intelligence**:
    Tree-sitter integration for AST traversal (e.g., symbol resolution in `tools/ast_grep_search`); ast-grep for rule-based transforms:

    ```yaml
    # Example pattern in tool call
    pattern: "fn $NAME($PARAMS) { $BODY }"
    replacement: "async fn $NAME($PARAMS) -> Result<()> { $BODY.await }"
    ```

    Supports preview mode to avoid destructive applies.

-   **MCP Integration**:
    Client uses official Rust SDK for protocol-compliant calls:
    ```rust
    let client = McpClient::new("ws://localhost:8080");
    let docs = client.call("get-library-docs", json!({
        "library_id": "/tokio/docs",
        "tokens": 5000,
        "topic": "async runtime"
    })).await?;
    ```
    Discovers tools dynamically (e.g., `mcp_resolve-library-id` for provider-specific IDs, `mcp_sequentialthinking` for chain-of-thought reasoning with branch/revision support, `mcp_get_current_time` for timezone-aware ops). Connection pooling and failover for multi-provider setups.

### CLI Execution (`src/`)

-   **User Interface**: Ratatui for reactive TUI (mouse-enabled, ANSI escape sequences for colors: e.g., \x1b[34m for blue tool banners). Real-time PTY via `vte` crate for command streaming; slash commands parsed with fuzzy matching.
-   **Runtime**: Tokio executor handles concurrent tool calls; human-in-the-loop via confirmation prompts for high-risk ops (e.g., `rm -rf` denials).
-   **Observability**: Logs to file/console with structured format; metrics (e.g., cache hit rate, token usage) exposed via debug flags.

Performance notes: Multi-threaded Tokio reduces latency for I/O-bound tasks (~20% faster than single-thread); context compression yields 50-80% token savings in long sessions. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for dependency graph and profiling data.

## Key Capabilities

-   **LLM Orchestration**: Failover logic (e.g., Gemini primary, OpenAI fallback); reasoning control (low/medium/high effort via provider params); caching with quality gating (cache only >70% confidence, TTL=30 days).
-   **Code Analysis & Editing**: Semantic search (AST-grep similarity mode, threshold=0.7); targeted edits (exact string match in `edit_file`, preserving whitespace); multi-file patches via `apply_patch`.
-   **Context & Session Management**: Phase-adaptive tool selection (e.g., validation phase favors `run_terminal_cmd` with `cargo test`); ledger injection for coherence (max 12 entries); summarization triggers at 20 turns or 85% budget.
-   **Extensibility**: Custom tools via trait impls; MCP for domain-specific extensions (e.g., library docs resolution: `resolve-library-id` → `get-library-docs` with max_tokens=5000).
-   **Security Posture**: Path validation (no escapes outside WORKSPACE_DIR); sandboxed network (curl HTTPS only, no localhost); allowlists (e.g., deny `rm`, permit `cargo`); env-var secrets (no file storage).

## Installation and Initialization

Binaries on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vinhnx/vtcode/releases/latest) support macOS (aarch64/x86_64-apple-darwin), Linux (x86_64/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu), Windows (x86_64-pc-windows-msvc).

Initialize environment:

```bash
# API keys (required for providers)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"  # Validate via curl test
# [RECOMMEND] use dot file .env in your project root: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Workspace setup
cd my-project
cp /path/to/vtcode.toml.example .vtcode/vtcode.toml  # Customize [mcp.enabled=true] etc.
```

Execution:

```bash
vtcode  # Launch TUI (loads vtcode.toml defaults)
vtcode --provider openai --model gpt-5-codex ask "Refactor async fn in src/lib.rs using ast-grep"  # Tool-enabled query
vtcode --debug --no-tools ask "Compute token budget for current context"  # Dry-run analysis
```

### Zed IDE integration (Agent Client Protocol)

The ACP bridge lets Zed treat VT Code as an external agent. Review the
[Zed ACP integration guide](https://github.com/vinhnx/vtcode/blob/main/docs/guides/zed-acp.md)
and the [docs.rs ACP reference](https://docs.rs/vtcode/latest/vtcode/#agent-client-protocol-acp)
for the complete workflow; the summary below captures the critical steps.

#### Setup overview
- Ensure a VT Code binary is built and reachable (either on `PATH` or via an absolute path).
- Enable the ACP bridge in `vtcode.toml` (or with environment overrides).
- Register VT Code as a custom ACP server inside Zed's `settings.json`.
- Launch the agent from Zed and confirm the stdio transport is healthy via ACP logs.

#### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain matching `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- A configured `vtcode.toml` with provider, model, and credentials.
- Zed `v0.201` or newer with the Agent Client Protocol feature flag enabled.

Build VT Code once for editor use (release profile recommended):

```bash
cargo build --release
```

If the binary is not on `PATH`, note the absolute location (`target/release/vtcode`).

#### Configure VT Code for ACP
1. Edit your `vtcode.toml` and enable the bridge:

```toml
[acp]
enabled = true

[acp.zed]
enabled = true
transport = "stdio"

[acp.zed.tools]
read_file = true
# NOTE: you can reference full tools in [tools.policies]
```

#### Register VT Code Agent in Zed
Add a custom agent entry to Zed's settings in `~/.config/zed/settings.json`:

```jsonc
{
    "agent_servers": {
        "vtcode": {
            "command": "/absolute/path/to/vtcode",
            "args": ["acp"],
        }
    }
}
```

Or you can check current vtcode PATH

```bash
which vtcode # $HOME/.cargo/bin/vtcode
```

If the binary is on `PATH`, shrink `command` to `"vtcode"`. Add extra flags (for example `--config`) as
needed to match your environment.

#### Use it inside Zed
1. Open the agent panel (`Cmd-?` on macOS) and create an **External Agent**.
2. Pick the `vtcode` entry you added. Zed spawns the ACP bridge over stdio.
3. Chat as normal; mention files with `@path/to/file` or attach buffers. Tool requests for
   `read_file` forward to Zed when enabled.

### Use custom model in VT Code agent in Zed
1. Review `vtcode.toml` config in your root workspace. If note you can create one. Reference https://github.com/vinhnx/vtcode/blob/main/vtcode.toml.example
2. You can set any provider and model
3. Open and repeat above step `Use it inside Zed` again to start VT Code

#### Debugging and verification
- Command palette → `dev: open acp logs` surfaces raw ACP traffic.
- Empty responses usually mean the environment overrides were not applied; double-check the `env`
  map in `settings.json`.
- Errors referencing the transport imply the config drifted away from `transport = "stdio"`.
- VT Code emits notices when tool calls are skipped because the model lacks function calling.

Configuration validation: On load, checks TOML against schema (e.g., model in `docs/models.json`); logs warnings for deprecated keys.

## Command-Line Interface

Parsed via clap derives:

```bash
vtcode [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND>

SUBCOMMANDS:
    ask <QUERY>     Non-interactive query with optional tools
    OPTIONS:
        --provider <PROVIDER>    LLM provider (default: from config)
        --model <MODEL>          Model ID (e.g., gemini-1.5-pro; from constants.rs)
        --no-tools               Disable tool execution (analysis only)
        --debug                  Enable verbose logging and metrics
        --help                   Print usage
```
Development runs: `./run.sh` (release profile: lto=true, codegen-units=1 for opt); `./run-debug.sh` (debug symbols, hot-reload via cargo-watch).

## Development Practices

-   **Validation Pipeline**: `cargo check` for incremental builds; `cargo clippy` with custom lints (e.g., no unsafe, prefer ? over unwrap); `cargo fmt --check` for style enforcement (4-space indents, max_width=100).
-   **Testing**: Unit tests in `#[cfg(test)]` modules; integration in `tests/` (e.g., mock LLM responses with wiremock); coverage via `cargo tarpaulin`. Property testing for tools (e.g., proptest for path sanitization).
-   **Error Handling**: Uniform `anyhow::Result<T>` with context:
    ```rust
    fn load_config(path: &Path) -> anyhow::Result<Config> {
        toml::from_str(&fs::read_to_string(path)?)
            .with_context(|| format!("Invalid TOML in {}", path.display()))?
    }
    ```
-   **Benchmarking**: Criterion in `benches/` (e.g., token counting: <50μs for 1k tokens); flamegraphs for async bottlenecks.
-   **Documentation**: Rustdoc for public APIs; Markdown in `./docs/` (e.g., [context engineering impl](docs/phase_1_2_implementation_summary.md)). No root-level Markdown except README.
