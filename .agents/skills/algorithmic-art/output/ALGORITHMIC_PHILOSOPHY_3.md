# Crystalline Memory

## Core Philosophy

Memory is not a record but a structure—built layer by layer, each adding to what came before without erasing it. Crystals grow in silence, taking centuries to form what takes an instant to admire.

## Computational Expression

This philosophy manifests through:
- **Growth as accumulation**: Each frame adds to the structure, never removing
- **Geometry as constraint**: Angles and symmetries guide the inevitable
- **Transparency as history**: Earlier layers remain visible through later ones
- **Time as color**: Older structures appear deeper, more saturated

## Aesthetic Principles

1. **Patience over speed**: Slow growth reveals more than rapid rendering
2. **Constraint as liberation**: Rules create the space for discovery
3. **Layered truth**: Multiple perspectives coexist without contradiction
4. **Mineral time**: The piece exists outside human temporal scales

## Technical Manifestation

The algorithm grows recursive geometric structures—hexagons, triangles, nested polygons—that branch and intersect. Each new layer inherits position from the previous but adds variation. The color palette draws from gemstones: quartz, amethyst, fluorite, obsidian.

The piece builds indefinitely, each moment a palimpsest of all moments before.
