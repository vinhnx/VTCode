# Digital Organisms

## Core Philosophy

Life emerges from simple rules repeated infinitely. In the digital realm, organisms are not born but constructed—cell by cell, generation by generation—through the patient accumulation of algorithmic DNA.

## Computational Expression

This philosophy manifests through:
- **Cells as building blocks**: Autonomous units that follow local rules
- **Division as growth**: Self-replication driven by environmental signals
- **Mutation as variation**: Controlled randomness that introduces novelty
- **Selection as refinement**: The canvas itself chooses what survives

## Aesthetic Principles

1. **Simplicity before complexity**: Start with the minimal viable organism
2. **Emergence over design**: Behavior arises from interaction, not instruction
3. **Organic imperfection**: Perfect symmetry is the opposite of life
4. **Continuous evolution**: The piece is never finished—it is always becoming

## Technical Manifestation

The algorithm simulates cellular automata that divide, mutate, and compete. Colors shift based on generational age, creating a gradient of "evolutionary time." The piece grows organically from the center, like a coral reef building itself from the ocean floor.

Like life itself, it is both random and inevitable.
