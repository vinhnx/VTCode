## Next Immediate Steps

### Today/Tomorrow
1. Complete AskCommand implementation
2. Add tests for AskCommand
3. Start AskSelectionCommand extraction
4. Document progress

### This Week (Remaining)
1. Extract remaining commands
2. Create CommandRegistry initialization
3. Refactor extension.ts to use registry
4. Create integration tests

### Next Week (Week 4)
1. Create participant implementations
2. Integrate with ChatView
3. Add @-mention support

---

## Risk Status

### Active Risks
1. **Command Extraction Complexity** (Medium)
   - Many commands have interdependencies
   - Mitigation: Extract one at a time, test each

2. **Performance** (Low)
   - Registry overhead
   - Mitigation: Benchmarking, lazy loading

3. **Integration Issues** (Medium)
   - Connecting to existing chatView
   - Mitigation: Integration tests

## Success Criteria Progress

| Criterion | Target | Current | Status |
|-----------|--------|---------|--------|
| extension.ts size | <200 lines | 2500+ | 🔄 In Progress |
| Commands extracted | 7 | 1 started | 🔄 In Progress |
| Participants created | 4 | 0 | ⏳ Next week |
| Test coverage | >90% | ~95% | ✅ Achieved |
| Breaking changes | 0 | 0 | ✅ Achieved |
| Documentation | 100% | 95% | ⏳ In Progress |

---

## Timeline Assessment

### On Track Indicators
✅ Infrastructure complete ahead of schedule  
✅ Tests all passing  
✅ Code quality metrics exceeded  

### Watch Items
⚠️ Command extraction may take longer than estimated  
⚠️ Need to integrate with existing extension.ts carefully  

### Status
**🟢 ON TRACK** - Infrastructure complete, starting execution phase

---

## Communication Summary

### For Tech Lead
Infrastructure is solid and well-tested. Ready to extract commands. No blockers identified. May need to review extension.ts integration approach.

### For Team
Command and participant registries are ready. You can start extracting commands following the AskCommand pattern. All infrastructure tests pass.

### For Stakeholders
Phase 2 Week 3 on schedule. Infrastructure complete. Command extraction starting. Will have full update by end of week.
