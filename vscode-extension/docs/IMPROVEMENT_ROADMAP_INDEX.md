## Decision Framework

**Should we proceed with Phase 2?**

```
 Is Phase 1 complete? → YES
 Are requirements clear? → YES
 Are resources available? → YES
 Is timeline realistic? → YES
 Are risks acceptable? → YES
 Will this enable Phase 3-4? → YES

DECISION:   PROCEED WITH PHASE 2
```

---

## FAQ

**Q: Can Phase 2 start before Phase 1 is integrated?**
A: No. Phase 1 code (status indicators, error handling) may be needed in Phase 2.

**Q: What if we can't find developers?**
A: Phase 2 can be extended to 6 weeks. Flexibility exists in timeline.

**Q: Can we modify Phase 2 scope?**
A: Minor changes OK. Major changes require tech lead approval and timeline adjustment.

**Q: What happens if Phase 2 fails?**
A: We have weekly checkpoints. Issues caught early. Clear rollback plan exists.

**Q: Is this a one-time refactor?**
A: No. Sets pattern for Phase 3-4. Future phases follow same architecture.
