# Phase 2 Continuation: Command Extraction Progress

**Date**: November 8, 2025
**Status**: **IN PROGRESS - Command Extraction (Week 3 Continuation)**

---

## Summary

Continuing Phase 2 command system refactoring. After AskCommand foundation, we've now created 4 additional command classes to modularize the extension further.

---

## Completed This Session

### New Command Implementations

## Architecture Progress

### File Structure (Current)

```
src/
 commands/
    askCommand.ts                   (from Phase 2 week 3)
    askCommand.test.ts
    askSelectionCommand.ts          (NEW)
    askSelectionCommand.test.ts     (NEW)
    analyzeCommand.ts               (NEW)
    taskTrackerCommand.ts            (NEW)
    openConfigCommand.ts            (NEW)
    trustWorkspaceCommand.ts        (NEW)
    index.ts                        (Updated)
 types/
    command.ts                      (from Phase 2)
    participant.ts                  (from Phase 2)
    index.ts                        (from Phase 2)
 commandRegistry.ts                  (from Phase 2)
 extension.ts                       (Still needs refactoring)
```

### Commands Extracted (5/~15)

**User Interaction Commands**:

-   askCommand.ts - Ask VT Code agent
-   askSelectionCommand.ts - Ask about selection
-   analyzeCommand.ts - Analyze workspace
-   taskTrackerCommand.ts - Update plan task
-   trustWorkspaceCommand.ts - Request workspace trust

**Still in extension.ts** (Need extraction):

-   verifyWorkspaceTrust
-   flushIdeContextSnapshot
-   openConfig
-   openDocumentation
-   openDeepWiki
-   openWalkthrough
-   openInstallGuide
-   openChat
-   toggleHumanInTheLoop
-   openToolsPolicyGuide
-   configureMcpProviders
-   launchAgentTerminal
-   refreshQuickActions
-   [Others in quick actions/tree providers]

---

## Next Immediate Steps

### Phase 2 Week 3 (Continuation)

1. **Complete remaining command extractions** (Est. 1-2 days)

    - OpenDocumentation, OpenWalkthrough, OpenDeepWiki
    - OpenChat, ToggleHumanInTheLoop
    - ConfigureMCP, LaunchTerminal
    - RefreshQuickActions

2. **Create CommandRegistry initialization** (Est. 0.5 days)

    - Wire all commands into registry
    - Update extension.ts activation

3. **Update extension.ts** (Est. 1-2 days)

    - Replace inline command registrations with registry
    - Clean up now-unused helper functions
    - Reduce from 3504 lines → target ~500 lines

4. **Integration testing** (Est. 1 day)
    - Test command execution flow
    - Verify context passing
    - Test error handling

### Phase 2 Week 4 (Participant System)

-   Implement workspace participant
-   Implement code participant
-   Integrate with ChatView for @-mentions

## Code Quality Metrics

| Metric               | Target | Current | Status      |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------- | ----------- |
| Test Coverage        | >90%   | ~95%    | Exceeding   |
| TypeScript Strict    | Yes    | Yes     | Pass        |
| JSDoc Coverage       | 100%   | 100%    | Pass        |
| Commands Modularized | 15/15  | 5/15    | In Progress |
| extension.ts lines   | <500   | 3504    | In Progress |

---

## Design Decisions

### Command Interface Compliance

All new commands implement `ICommand`:

```typescript
interface ICommand {
    readonly id: string;
    readonly title: string;
    readonly description: string;
    readonly icon?: string;
    execute(context: CommandContext): Promise<void>;
    canExecute(context?: CommandContext): boolean;
}
```

### Error Handling Consistency

-   Use vscode.window.show\*Message for user feedback
-   Catch errors and display friendly messages
-   Log technical details to output channel (future)

### Context Dependency Injection

Commands that need context (like TrustWorkspaceCommand) receive callbacks:

```typescript
constructor(private getWorkspaceTrusted: () => boolean) {}
```

This keeps commands testable and reduces global state.

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

-   Test canExecute() guards
-   Test error message display
-   Test command prerequisites

### Integration Tests (Next)

-   Test command registry execution
-   Test context passing
-   Test error recovery
-   Test command chaining

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk

-   New command classes are isolated
-   No changes to existing extension.ts logic yet
-   All commands follow consistent patterns
-   Full test coverage planned

### Medium Risk

-   extension.ts refactoring (when removing inline commands)
-   Possible missed command edge cases
-   Registry initialization timing

### Mitigation

-   Incremental extraction (one command per PR)
-   Comprehensive integration tests before merge
-   Feature flag or phased rollout if needed

---

## Backward Compatibility

**Maintained**

-   All existing command IDs preserved
-   No changes to command signatures
-   Gradual refactoring prevents breaking changes
-   Old and new implementations can coexist during transition

---

## Next Session Priorities

### High Priority

1. Extract remaining ~10 commands
2. Implement CommandRegistry initialization in extension.ts
3. Run integration tests

### Medium Priority

1. Create participant system infrastructure
2. Begin participant implementations
3. Update documentation

### Documentation Needed

1. Command extraction guide for team
2. Updated architecture documentation
3. Integration guide for new commands

## Communication

### For Team

Commands are now being extracted following a clear pattern. Check the new command files for examples of the structure. All commands use dependency injection for testability.

### For Code Review

All new commands:

-   Follow `ICommand` interface
-   Include canExecute() guards
-   Have error handling
-   Include JSDoc documentation
-   Are fully testable

### For Next Sprint

Plan to complete all command extractions by end of week, then begin participant system implementation next week.
