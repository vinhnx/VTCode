## One-Page Overview

### What is Phase 2?

Phase 2 transforms the VSCode extension from a monolithic codebase into a **modular, plugin-like architecture** that enables future improvements and scaling.

### Key Changes

| Aspect | Current | After Phase 2 |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| extension.ts | 500+ lines | <200 lines |
| Commands | Hardcoded inline | Modular, testable |
| Context System | Single static context | Dynamic @ mention system |
| Participants | None | 4 built-in participants |
| State Management | Array-based | Lifecycle-aware message store |
| Test Coverage | ~60% | >90% |
| Extensibility | Limited | High (plugin-ready) |

## For Technical Leads

### Architecture Goals

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Commands: User actions
   - Participants: Context providers
   - State: Message management
   - Backend: VTCode integration

2. **Extensibility**
   - Add new commands without touching core
   - Add new participants for new contexts
   - Plugin-ready architecture

3. **Testability**
   - Each module independently testable
   - Clear interfaces (ICommand, ChatParticipant)
   - Mock-friendly design

### Key Design Patterns

```typescript
// 1. Command Pattern
interface ICommand {
  execute(context): Promise<void>
  canExecute(context): boolean
}

// 2. Participant Pattern  
interface ChatParticipant {
  canHandle(context): boolean
  resolveReferenceContext(msg, context): Promise<string>
}

// 3. Registry Pattern
class CommandRegistry { registerAll(): void }
class ParticipantRegistry { registerAll(): void }
```

### Code Quality Metrics

- **Coverage**: >90% (from ~60%)
- **Complexity**: Lower (modularization)
- **Duplication**: Reduced (shared patterns)
- **Maintainability**: Higher (clear ownership)

export async function activate() {
  // 20+ commands hardcoded inline
  vscode.commands.registerCommand('vtcode.ask', async () => {
    // 50+ lines of logic
  })
  // ... repeated 20+ times
}

// Features
- Single context system
- Basic error handling
- Limited extensibility
- Hard to test
```

### After Phase 2
```typescript
// extension.ts (<200 lines)
export async function activate() {
  const registry = new CommandRegistry(backend, config)
  registry.registerAll()
}

// src/commands/askCommand.ts
export class AskCommand implements ICommand {
  async execute(context) { ... }
  canExecute(context): boolean { ... }
}

// Features
- Modular commands
- Participant system (@workspace, @code, @terminal, @git)
- Enhanced state management
- Fully testable
- Plugin-ready

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can this be done in less time?**  
A: Possible but risky. 4 weeks allows thorough testing and documentation.

**Q: What happens if we skip Phase 2?**  
A: Phase 3 features become much harder. Phase 2 is the foundation.

**Q: Will users notice changes?**  
A: Not negatively. Internal refactoring. They'll benefit in Phase 3-4.

**Q: Can we do Phase 2 and 3 in parallel?**  
A: No. Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 architecture.

**Q: What if something breaks?**  
A: We have tests and can rollback. Clear safe points weekly.
