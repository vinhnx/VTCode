//! Cross-platform command runner modeled after VTCode's original bash
//! wrapper. The crate exposes a trait-based executor so downstream
//! applications can swap the underlying process strategy (system shell,
//! pure-Rust emulation, or dry-run logging) while reusing the higher-level
//! helpers for workspace-safe filesystem manipulation.
