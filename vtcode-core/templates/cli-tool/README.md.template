Edit `tool.json` to customize:
- `executable_path`: Path to the actual tool executable
- `timeout_seconds`: Maximum execution time

## Usage

Once installed, this tool can be invoked through VT Code's skill system.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the wrapped command (`{{tool_command}}`) is available in PATH
