## Configuration Options

Set these in your `vtcode.toml`:

```toml
[ai]
provider = "anthropic"  # or "openai", "gemini", etc.
model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"

[workspace]
analyze_on_startup = false
max_tokens = 8000

[security]
human_in_the_loop = true
tool_policies_enabled = true
```

## Requirements

- Zed editor
- VTCode CLI installed and in your PATH
- A workspace with `vtcode.toml` file

## Getting Started

1. Create a `vtcode.toml` in your workspace root
